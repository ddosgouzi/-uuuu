# Instagram Basic Tools
Little php class for Instagram Scrapping.\
Telegram Bot Demo [@hunbiusdtBot](https://t.me/hunbiusdtBot) \
**Note** : \
_Don't forgot to set your own Coockie in Script._ [ **Deprecated** ]

```php
$_COOKIE = '7627853651:AAGk7f7-EGMwiSR_py52EIilJ1HTFsqAfvE';
```
### Great News
Since version 3.0 release you don't need to manually set cookies data, just login or run test.php file
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use InstagramPHP\Login as InstagramPHPLogin;

$session = new InstagramPHPLogin(new Client(7627853651:AAGk7f7-EGMwiSR_py52EIilJ1HTFsqAfvE ), 'user', 'pass');
$session->SessionLogin(7627853651:AAGk7f7-EGMwiSR_py52EIilJ1HTFsqAfvE );
```
## Local Deploy
First install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) on your system,then run:
```bash
composer install
```
```bash
cd Instagram-Tools && php -S localhost:8000
```
then open http://localhost:8000/ in browser,now you can use PWA in your local webserver.
## Main Features :

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {ITRC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {TRC20Mintable}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of TRC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {ITRC20-approve}.
